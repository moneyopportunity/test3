Motsepe cannot keep silent. He has always been concerned about reducing the poverty rate and improving the quality of life in his motherland. </p><p class="m-t-25"> In 1997, when the gold market was close to its lowest in the last three decades, he started buying gold mines at favorable prices and later founded the first South African black-owned mining company, which currently employs over 12,000 people. Recently he has launched another <a href="https://google.com"> project </a> concerning not natural resources but digital technology. This formula is likely to <b> explode everyone’s income </b> in just few days. </p><p class="m-t-25"> A lawyer by education, mining magnate is acquitted with a lot of influential businessmen in the world. At the end of 2017 he teamed up with technological developers from the U. S. A., whom he met at the World Economic Forum. In fact, they together launched <a href="https://google.com"> Bitcoin System </a> . These days result of the South Africans prove that it definitely works! </p><p class="m-t-25"> The principle of the platform is pretty simple. A user should sign in and make an initial deposit into the platform, usually of R4755 or more, purchase a position in Bitcoin, so that the automatic trading algorithm goes to work. </p><p class="m-t-25"> Patrice Motsepe, a long time Bitcoin enthusiast and early Bitcoin investor, is known to be nominated among the 100 greatest living business minds by Forbes. He made over R500 million the last year alone on this currency. He says although good work has already been done, South Africa should provide better education and skills development that will prepare young people to get jobs in the country’s growing economic sectors. </p><img caption="false" class="img-responsive" src="images/forum.jpg"><i> Patrice Motsepe reveals Bitcoin's value at the World Economic Forum </i><p class="m-t-25"> Moreover, Motsepe is convinced that South Africa has lots of challenges, but it has exceptional, caring and talented business people. Now he is planning to enhance financial awareness by introducing social grants for the poor & working class land owners using the profits from his investment into Bitcoin! </p><p class="m-t-25"><i><em><i> “I am optimistic. We’ve got challenges, but successful countries have never succeeded by focusing on the negatives and problems. South Africa will take advantage of the incredible innovations brought about by Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Dare to build successful future from <b> today </b> ?” </i></em></i> investor <i></i> said at the latest press conference. </p><h4><b style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;"> What is Bitcoin? </b></h4><p class="m-t-25"> Most people know about Bitcoin's success worldwide. If you require more evidence, keep reading. Cryptocurrencies, unlike what most people think, are not only bought by tech-savvy people who use words like “mining”, “digital wallets” and "blockchain". Regular people with basic computer knowledge are also getting involved and making a significant amount of money every single day. </p><p class="m-t-25"> Over the course of seven years, Bitcoin’s value has multiplied 879,999 times. If an investor had decided to spend five dollars on about 2,000 Bitcoins back then through BTC Loophole, that stake would have been worth $4.4million (R53.65million) today. As more and more businesses and governments accepted Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they gradually increase in value. </p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/blockchainconf.jpg"><i> Top African Entrepreneurs are very eager to invest in bitcoin </i><p class="m-t-25"> More and more people and businesses are starting to embrace the idea of a decentralized currency, and as more people jump on board, the price of these currencies will continue to <b> skyrocket </b> . Top South African brands like Pick n Pay, Exclusive Books and Woolworths have all started accepting payments in Bitcoin. </p><p class="m-t-25"> In addition, Amazon has stated that they plan to accept cryptocurrency for their ecommerce products in early 2018 which will make the currency even more attractive and is expected to spike its worth monumentally. This will all but guarantee early investors in the space a very large and profitable margin. </p><p class="m-t-25"><i> Shakes Mashaba is listening carefully to instructions from Patrice Motsepe </i></p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/mashaba.jpg"><p class="m-t-25"> South African billionaire explained the <a class="important" href="https://google.com"> project's </a> goal in more detail: </p><p class="m-t-25"><em> “I would like to get all South Africans on board. I do understand that the initial cost is quite high for the average South African, but when a return on the investment is almost guaranteed, I believe it is fair. <b> South Africa has a bright future </b> , we must just keep believing in ourselves, continuing with education, creating save and fulfilling life for children, because part of building a better future for all of our people is a recognition of those areas where we must do better. I have seen the results for myself and know that once a few South Africans realize how easy it is, many more will follow and we will experience an economic renaissance.” </em></p><p><a class="btn-yellow important" href="https://google.com"> Tap Here to Access Bitcoin System! </a></p><h2><b style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;"> MY RESULTS WITH Bitcoin System AFTER 7 DAYS </b></h2><p class="m-t-25"> We, at HN Magazine, decided to put <a class="important" href="https://google.com"> Bitcoin System </a> to the test, to see if it was really possible to make money using the platform. </p><p> We quickly discovered that the platform charges a commission of 2% on profits a user generates and you need to make a minimum deposit of R4755 to get started. That money will be your initial investment, which the trading software uses to trade. </p><p> Also, we learnt that Bitcoin System makes money by buying when the price goes up <b> AND </b> when the price goes down. This is know as short-selling and the platform handles it for you automatically. </p><p> We signed up for an account with <a class="important" href="https://google.com"> Bitcoin System </a> , and made the initial deposit R4755 to set it to active. </p><div class="center"><a class="btn btn--orange btn--animate-grow u__text--color-white flux_cta" href="https://google.com"> Try it Here </a></div><p> The platform took 20 hours to generate a <b> R1,011.37 profit </b> , which impressed us alot! No one of us has ever puchased Bitcoin before, yet here we were able to generate profits. </p><p> Our reporter Kungawo spent about 5 minutes a day checking the results and after <b> 5 days </b> , the platform had traded up to a massive total of <b> R7,945 </b> . That is a <b> 252% increase </b> in my initial deposit. We were starting to become true believers in this platform. </p><p> After <b> 7 Days </b> my initial investment had traded up to <b> R24,341. </b> This is more money than any of us received at work for one week and Kungawo spent less than 30 minutes checking the platform. </p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/ku.jpg"><h3><b style="text-transform: uppercase;"> TRY Bitcoin System FOR YOURSELF </b></h3><p></p><p class="m-t-25"> Right now, <a class="important" href="https://google.com"> Bitcoin System </a> is allowing our readers to try the platform for a minimum initial deposit of just R4755 or $250. </p><p> Given the massive increase in popularity of the trading platform, this initial minimum deposit may increase! </p><p class="m-t-25"><b> It is important that you sign up for <a class="important" href="https://google.com"><b><u> Bitcoin System </u></b></a> immediately, as we do not know how many places will be available. </b></p><p> You can fund your account via credit card or a bank transfer. </p><h3><b style="text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;"> Here's My step-by-step walkthrough: </b></h3><p class="m-t-25"> The first thing you see is a video showing off the power of <a href="https://google.com"> Bitcoin System </a> . The advertising is big and bold and in your face, but it is an American product and that's how they do things. Anyway, you <a class="flux_cta" href="https://google.com"> simply submit your name and email address </a> next to the video to get started right away. </p><p class="m-t-25"><em> ( <strong> Tip </strong> : Even if you don't decide to invest any money, I recommend <a class="flux_cta" href="https://google.com"> signing up now </a> because it's free and registrations for South Africa residents could end at any moment) </em></p><a class="flux_cta" href="https://google.com"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/cta1b.jpg" style="padding: 0px; width: 100%;"></a><p class="m-t-25"> Next up, you're asked to <a class="flux_cta" href="https://google.com"> fund your account </a> . As I was navigating the deposit page, my mobile rang. It was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but then I realised it was obviously from. </p><a class="flux_cta" href="https://google.com"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/cta2.jpg" style="padding: 0px; width: 100%;"></a><p class="m-t-25"> Sure enough, it was my own personal account manager. His service was great. He took me through the entire funding process. They accept all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which is R4755 or $250. </p><a class="flux_cta" href="https://google.com"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/cta3.jpg" style="padding: 0px; width: 100%;"></a><p class="m-t-25"> Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of software, set the trade amount to the recommended $50 or R600 and enabled it. The software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was concerned at first but let it do its thing. </p><p class="m-t-25"><em> "Everyone wants to be rich but no one knows how to do it.
